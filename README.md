# GenderGapGame
This is the final Javascript and JQuery project for Nicole Javorsky and Triana Kalmanoff, students at Barnard College. We were inspired to create a game exhibiting gender differences in the U.S. for household duties in the average day.
According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, women spend significantly more time on household chores and responsibilities than men do.
Just like how Ferris Bueller took a day off from school, play our game simulating a day off from work for the average woman or man!
