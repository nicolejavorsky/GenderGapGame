				This is the final Javascript and JQuery project for Nicole Javorsky and Triana Kalmanoff, students at Barnard College. We were inspired to create a game exhibiting gender differences in the U.S. for household duties in the average day. According to the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/TUS/CHARTS/HOUSEHOLD.HTM">United States Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, women spend significantly more time on household chores and responsibilities than men do.

				<strong>Just like how Ferris Bueller took a day off from school, play our game simulating a day off from work for the average woman or man!</strong>
